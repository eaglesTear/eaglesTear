- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Ryan here.

- Recent full-stack bootcamp graduate.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m ready to begin a career in web development and web application development, or HTML5 game dev. I'm working tirelessly to build every day in order to learn. I've even included a few projects from the earliest days of teaching myself web design and programming. It all shows a journey of making mistakes and experimenting, right up to tackling more conventional web projects.

- ðŸ“« I'm available for work as a full-stack junior web application developer. I built all the stuff you see here in my free time and I learn my craft properly.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building a full-stack Node JS website for a counselling charity, whilst learning Phaser.js & React.js. 

Reach me on my LinkedIn page: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-had.
